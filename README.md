# Defining Front-End Web Programming

## Learning Goals

- Define web programming
- Contrast web pages versus web applications
- Identify a reference example: "Liking on social media"
- Identify Flatiron's "Three Pillars of Web Programming"

## Introduction

The phrase "Front-End Web Programming" is used in different ways by different
people. In this lesson, we're going to choose a definition of "web programming"
and show an example that demonstrates what we call the "three pillars" of web
programming. We will explore each of those pillars in detail in upcoming
lessons.

## What Exactly Does "Web Programming" Mean Anyway?

Web programming, at its heart, is:

- Creating documents with HTML and styling/positioning the documents' content
  with CSS
- Using JavaScript to provide interactivity
- Using JavaScript to notify remote servers

## Web Page vs. Web Application

When a web page has a lot of JavaScript code, the page feels closer to a
computer application, so some people may call it a "**web application**."
However, it's worth noting that there is _**no clear distinction**_ between a
"web page" and a "web application." For instance, there's no rule like "When
there are three or more actions it's a web application!" Different people draw the
boundary differently. More or less, we call a web page an "application" when it
feels "rich."

## Identify a Reference Example: Liking on Social Media

As we move through the rest of this material, we're going to use _one, tiny_
interaction as our shared or "reference" example.

> **Web Programming Example**: "Favoriting" a social media post.

Regardless of the social media site (Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook, LinkedIn,
Twitter), the interaction goes something like this:

Step 1: The site renders some HTML content that is styled using CSS

Step 2: You see the content and decide to show your approval of it

Step 3: You _click_ some visual element meant to show approval (heart,
   thumbs-up, +1, etc.). For example:

   ![heart](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/defining-fewp/heart.png)

Step 4: The visual element _updates_ (animates, goes from empty to full, jiggles,
   etc) like:  

   ![full heart](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/defining-fewp/full-heart.png)

Step 5: Behind the scenes, the application _tells the provider_ that this
   post has gained your approval so that the central provider can store
   this information and use it later (for example, to notify the post
   author that you liked their post).

If all goes as it should, the entire interaction only takes a second or two.
But even this small interaction demonstrates all the concepts of front-end web
programming.

## Flatiron's "Three Pillars of Web Programming"

To help us learn web programming in three distinct phases, this curriculum is
broken down into three essential "pillars":

![three pillars](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-1/defining-fewp/Image_31_ThreePillarsConcept.png)

- **Recognize Events**
- **Manipulate the DOM**
- **Communicate with the Server**

Let's take another look at steps 3 through 5 of our Favoriting a Social Media
Post example. Note that we _italicized_ a verb in each step. Those words
exemplify the activity of one of the "pillars" we must learn in order to make
web applications.

- Step 3 showed **Recognizing JS events**: Your _click_ action on the empty
  heart tells JavaScript to do work.

- Step 4 showed **Manipulating the DOM**: the work JavaScript was told to do
  was to _update_ the screen to make the heart "look clicked."

- Step 5 showed **Communicating with the server**: the work JavaScript was
  told to do was to _tell the social media company_ that you approved of this
  content.

> **THINKING ABOUT LEARNING:** These "pillars" are not something professional
> developers outside Flatiron School recognize. You won't go into a
> tech interview and be asked: "Name the three pillars of web programming."
> These abstractions are a way to help learners (you!) recognize how what
> you're learning fits into three major activity areas. That said, if an
> interviewer asked you how to debug a web program and you said your strategy
> would be based on ensuring three "critical areas" were working, we think your
> interview answer would be off to a good start!

Now you know what's going on when you click that heart! The next lessons will
focus on explaining each of these "pillars" in more detail. After you've worked
your way through them, your new "web programmer" eyes will have you looking at
your favorite sites very differently.

## Conclusion

Web Programming consists of creating documents with HTML, styling/positioning
the documents' content with CSS, and using JavaScript to respond to events. We
can break down the JavaScript part of web programming into three "pillars":
recognizing events, updating the DOM, and informing the server. Now
that we've seen how these pillars are connected in the abstract, we are ready to
dive into seeing how they work together in detail.
